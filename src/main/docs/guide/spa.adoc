Within the `client` directory, edit the file `src/App.js` as shown below:

.client/src/App.js
[source,javascript]

include::{sourceDir}/client/src/App.js[indent=0]

<1> Define some initial state
<2> Method to update the `name` property
<3> Method to make a request to the server to retrieve the "Hello" message
<4> Form to accept the user's name
<5> Conditionally display message from the server

[source,javascript]

include::{sourceDir}/client/src/config.js[indent=0]
----
