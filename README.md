# Building a Single-Page-App with Micronaut and VueJS  #

This is a copy of the [micronaut-spa-react](https://github.com/micronaut-guides/micronaut-spa-react) repository, modified to include a VueJS - based single page application, instead of React.

The original React - based guide is available at http://guides.micronaut.io/micronaut-spa-react/guide/index.html

This repository also contains a modified version of the Guide, with instructions changed for the VueJS client.

The ```/initial``` folder can be used to walk through the guide.  The ```/complete``` folder is another version, with all of the guide steps completed.
